# Downtown Development in Coraopolis, PA

Coraopolis is a small borough in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, with a population of ~5488 as of 2019. The app explores the current business landscape in the borough with the intention to unearth potential for new business opportunities in the downtown. In such quest, the application is broken into three tabs:

1. **Coraopolis Map**: The map shows the concentration of the businesses in Coraopolis. Users have the flexbility to filter by either streets or business type. This will help us understand, for example, where the restaurants are mostly located in the downtown. Furthermore, the heatmap shows the revenue earned by individual stores, which further helps dissect the clusters of revenue sources, if any.

2. **Data Table**: The data table enables to users to build a personalized table that houses the application. Filters include revenue sliders, streets, and industry type. Once done, they can download the table with ease.

3. **Business Landscape**: The two tabs in the business landscape breaks down the sales percentage by industry and the relationship between rent, square footage (area), and the street. The bar plots give us an insight on the rent given the area and location and perhaps, the availability of square footage by streets for future business owners.

See the good for yourself!
